# Cellular Automata
- To change the rule the cell is operating on, change the movement varible in the main file.
- [**R**] this will clear the screen, reset the cell, and give it a random rule to follow.
- [**p**] will pause the cell in its current position
- [**i**] will increment the cell by one space when paused
- [**t**] will turn on/off shaders
- [**s**] will take a screenshot of the window
- [**m**] will start recording the window
- Numbers [**0 - 9**] and Letters [**A - F**] will change the colour palette
- to change the scale, change the scale varible in the data file. smaller scalling may slow it down, but a scalling of one will be faster than 2 because it draws the canvas in a different way
- click the window at different location to change the speed ([**Vertical - FPS**, **Horizontal - Update Speed**])
